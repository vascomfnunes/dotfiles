# A-vim-like-firefox-like-configuration-for-w3m
Some points about this configuration

- This is a configuration for [w3m](https://sourceforge.net/projects/w3m) that aims to be compatible with shortcuts of
  vim-like browsers, complements (e.g. dwb, VimFx) and firefox/chrome.
- Vim-like shortcuts are preferable to firefox shortcut, So in a case that I
  can only implement one I will choose vim-like
- Many features of w3m AFAIK are not incorporated in any of these browsers, so
  the complete compatibility is not posible (e.g. BACK = delete current buffer
  and go back in history)
- This configuration is work in progresss
