 Searchengines

The ideal is the behavior of the "Smart keywords" in Firefox [0] [1]
In the location bar you can start a search with a keyword and a search string
e.g., "w chair" will search "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair"
the entries that define this behavior are in the Firefox bookmarks in the
following way

Name:		Search Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Location:	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%s&title=Special%3ASearch
Tags:
Keyword:	w
Description:

This file show my findings in how to get the closest behavior.

Best solution right now: 2

1.
- Use https://duckduckgo.com/lite/ with bangs [2] [3]
  - duckduckgo bangs
    e.g., "!w chair" it will search "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair"
  - This method is worse than "the ideal" because:
    - You need to go to duckduckgo.com first
    - The search goes through duckduckgo (bangs) instead of directly
    - Bangs are not user defined.

2.
- Use ~/.w3m/cgi-bin/search_engines.cgi script and ~/.w3m/urimethodmap file
  - You need to open the location bar e.g., using GOTO or TAB_GOTO, clear
    the field (ctrl+u) and then input [KEYWORD]:[THE-SEARCH-TERM]
    e.g., w:chair will send you to "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair"
  - The location bar doesn't allow spaces, so in order to separate words in the
    search this script has a subtitution that converts hyphens () to "%20" the
    equivalent string to a space in URL encoding
    e.g., y:the-curse-of-issyos-gameplay
  - You can add/edit search engines modifying the files search_engines.cgi and
    urimethodmap
  - The search can be made directly to the site (not with duckduckgo bangs)
  - Or you can use duckduckgo bangs e.g., d:yt!-gaming will search "gaming" in
    youtube throught duckduckgo
  - This method is worse than "the ideal" because:
    - You need to create a subtitution to add spaces
    - Duckduckgo results go through a duckduckgo redirection instead of
      directly
    - The keywords plus colon are treated as url inside the page
      e.g, the keyword "s:" in the prase "Links:"

 TODO

- Look a way to use surfraw inside w3m
- use DICT_WORD (it allow spaces)
- bug. In 2. when you search d:yt!-multi-word-string it will search in youtube
  with the hypens included instead of using spaces
- Searches made in duckduckgo.com/lite/ do not alter the url
  Searches made with 2. or surfraw in duckduckgo alter the url
  The format of the results in duckduckgo.com/lite are better
  guess.solution: maybe some user agent string
- It is possible to create a pop-up menu like the vomnibar of vimium?
